                <h2>Futura</h2>
                <h2>Condensed</h2>
                <p1>Futura, a typeface by German typeface designer, Paul Renner, was released in 1927 (<a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt#fonts-section">Futura</a>). Futura is a geometric sans-serif typeface, which means it is based on geometric shapes. Originally designed as a contribution to The New Frankfurt housing project in Germany, Futura is heavily influenced by Bauhaus deisgn. Futura is unique because it avoids decorative and non-essential elements.</p1>

            <div>
                <p2>The letterforms are very balanced.</p2>
            </div>
              
                <p3>For example, every stem is a rectangle or straight line and all letters have the same stroke weight (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)">Typeface</a>).</p3>

            <div>
                <p4>I chose to highlight the character “K” in Futura Condensed. For many typefaces, the “K” has one diagonal arm connected to the stem and a diagonal leg connected to the arm. The “K” is unique in Futura Condensed because the two diagonals come together to meet the vertical stem in the middle.</p4>
