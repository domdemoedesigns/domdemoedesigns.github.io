        <h2>The Solar System</h2>
        <p>Our Solar System consists of four main components. The Sun, the planets, the satellites of the planets, and comets, asteroids, and meteors. The sun is a star that is central to our Solar System. Each of the other components orbit around the sun due to its gravitational pull. The planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto (in order from closest to the sun to furthest away). The satellites of the planets are also known as moons. Earth has one moon but some planets have more than 50 and some don't have any at all! Comets, asteroids, and meteors make up the fourth component of the Solar System, they are essentially smaller pieces of planets or moons.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>The whole solar system, along with the stars that are visibile on a clear night, orbits the center of our home galaxy, a spiral disk made up of billions of stars. We call this spiral disk the Milky Way.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>The Milky Way has two small galaxies orbiting it nearby, which are visible from the southern hemisphere. They are called the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. The planets and the asteroids revolve around the sun in the same direction, in nearly circular orbits.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Planets</h2>
        <p>There are more planets than stars in our galaxy (since the only star in our galaxy is the Sun). The current count orbiting the Sun is eight. There are the inner, rocky planets, which are closest to the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Then, there are the outer planets: the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter and Saturn are called the gas giants because they are made almost entirely of gas and are much larger than the inner rocky planets. Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are also mostly gaseous planets, but they are called ice giants because the core of the planet consists mainly of ice and liquids. Pluto is the furthest "planet" from the Sun. It is much smaller than the other outer planets and even the inner planets. It is now considered to be a new type of planet named a "dwarf planet". Dwarf planets are a class of smaller planets far from the sun.

        <br>

        <p>The planets included in Solar System Memory were Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>Moons orbit planets and asteroids. They come in many shapes, sizes, and types. Most moons do not have any air, but some of them have atmospheres and even hidden oceans. There are many moons in our solar system â€“ even a few asteroids have small companion moons.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The moons included in Solar System Memory were from Mars, the Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. Mars has two moons named Deimos and Phobos. The Earth has one moon, officially known as the Moon. Jupiter has 79 moons!! 79 is the most of any planet and the ones included were Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are three of the four of Jupiter's moons that we know the most about. Saturn has 62 moons. The ones included in Solar System Memory were Enceladus and Titan.</p>

        <h2>Asteroids, Comets and Meteors</h2>
        <p>Asteroids and comets are leftovers from the formation of our solar system billions of years ago. Meteors sometimes come from either asteroids or comets. Asteroids, comets and meteors are essentially small chunks of ice, rock or metal (and sometimes all of the above). Asteroids orbit the sun like planets. Comets are pieces of ice and dust that form a "tail" when nearing the sun. This "tail" is made up of gas and dust particles and points away from the sun. Meteors are small pieces of asteroids and comets that have broken off and entered the Earth's atmosphere. There are currently 793,533 known asteroids and 3564 known comets.</p>
