                <h2>Futura / Book</h2>
                <p1>Futura, a typeface by German typeface designer, Paul Renner, was released in 1927 (<a
                  href= "https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt#fonts-section">Futura</a>).
                  It is a geometric sans-serif typeface and it was designed as a contribution to the New
                  Frankfurt housing project. The typeface, Futura, is based on geometric shapes, and is heavily
                  influenced by the Bauhaus design style that was popular of the time. Futura is unique because
                  it avoids decorative and non essential elements. The letterforms are very balanced, for example,
                  every stem is a rectangle or straight line and all letters have the same stroke weight (<a

            </div>

            <div>
                <p2>I chose to highlight the character “K” in Futura. For many typefaces, the “K” has one diagonal
                  connected to the stem and a leg connected to that diagonal. The “K” is unique in Futura because
                  the two diagonals come together to meet the vertical stem in the center.</p2>
